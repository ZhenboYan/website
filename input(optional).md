## 1. Photography & Visual Assets

These are critical to the site's design. All photos should be high-resolution (minimum 1600px on the longest side), provided as JPG or PNG. No heavy filters — natural, warm tones preferred.

| # | Asset | Specs | Used On | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | **Hero headshot** | Portrait orientation (3:4 aspect ratio). Professional but warm — editorial, not corporate. Should feel like a magazine portrait. | Home (hero) | Launch Blocker | ⬜ |
| 1.2 | **Candid / event photo** | You speaking, hosting, in conversation, or at an event. Portrait orientation (4:5 aspect ratio). | Home (about preview), About page | Launch Blocker | ⬜ |
| 1.3 | **About page portrait** | Can be the same as 1.1 or a different editorial portrait. This is the visual anchor of the About page — should feel generous and warm. Landscape or portrait (3:4 or 2:3). | About page | Launch Blocker | ⬜ |
| 1.4 | **Work With Me photo (optional)** | A photo for the Advisory or Consulting section. Could be you in a meeting, at a startup event, or a lifestyle shot. | Work With Me page | Nice to Have | ⬜ |
| 1.5 | **Additional candids (optional, 2-3)** | Any additional photos for variety — events, travel, speaking. These give the developer flexibility for section backgrounds or accent images. | Various | Nice to Have | ⬜ |
| 1.6 | **Favicon source** | Either: (a) your preferred initials treatment / mark, or (b) approval for the developer to design a simple "CM" favicon in the site's serif font on the warm background. | Global | Launch Blocker | ⬜ |
| 1.7 | **OG image source** | Either: (a) a specific image you want used when the site is shared on social media (1200x630px), or (b) approval for the developer to create one using your name + brand colors. | Global (meta) | Launch Blocker | ⬜ |
